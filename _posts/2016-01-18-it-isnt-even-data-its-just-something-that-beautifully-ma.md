So why did I decide
to become an Uber driver?

In my last piece I
very briefly pointed out that it is not economical to be an Uber driver, and if
that truly is the case - no one in the right frame of mind would think that for
an intangible, unquantifiable aspect of social opportunities, I should be Ubering
for that very sole purpose!

You would be fairly
right. If it isn't quantifiable, then it isn't reliable or repeatable. 

# It isn't even data. It's just something that
beautifully, magically happens.

To understand why my
agenda aligns itself with Uber, one must understand what I am doing.

And I am embarking
on a purely social media venture.

As Facebook's
algorithms change, so does the strategy surrounding it. Some may dispute that
it is foolhardy to base an entire business on platforms that one does not even
own and businesses can die in a heartbeat.

# But a website on the
internet isn't so much better either.

But to almost
virtually everyone, or at least 80% of everyone - **Google is the internet** and
every website and publisher is subject to its search engine indexing policies.
That's Google's way of deciding which website goes to the top of their first
page, which ends up on the 7th page.

If it's starting to
sound important for any business now, you would at least by now be able to
relate that a) a comprehensive digital marketing strategy is crucial to get
yourself on the first page, and b) yes, Google's algorithm do change and
websites do die in a heartbeat- just like Facebook.

But the topic of an
ever-changing business landscape and why I think it is ridiculous to build not
build an indefensible business is not what's on today's cooking list. Maybe
next time, perhaps!

So how do I get some
center stage time on Facebook?

Not in the same way
Search Engine Optimization works, which is 100% of the time executed online.

# A completely digital
marketing strategy that lives and breathes digitally just won't fly
anymore.

The first step to
maximizing your Facebook potential, you got to take it to the next level,
offline.

In the current form
of Facebook at the time of this post, user engagement is the name of the game.
Facebook likes do not matter as much to Facebook in deciding how much show time
your content gets fed to readers. 

But they are still
important in brand image. Your readers still see how many likes your page has.
More likes incite people to like your page even more, because - gravity.

# If you are a bigger
shit than something, things are going to get attracted to you, and they are
going to want to stick around you. 

# That's pretty much all the gravity you need to know.

And it
can be applied pretty broadly in almost all aspects of life, metaphorically of
course. 

Going back to topic,
the number of page likes is something readers can very visibly see and quantify
and decide if your page is a big enough shit worth liking or not.

Ala the more likes
you get, the easier it is that you are going to get even more likes simply
based on gravity.

# Which brings us back to brand image. 

# Be the bigger shit.

Even if in the current form of Facebook, page likes do not affect your post reach potential as much as it did before.
