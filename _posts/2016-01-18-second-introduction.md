Hi, I am Raymond and
at the start of 2016 I am going lone wolf to find? (found?) a media company.

This isn't my first
venture, but it will be my first foray as a founder and I am ecstatic.

In my last
experience, I was part of a technology hardware startup that built an amazing
3D printer. We spent years in development and a lot of resources was spent on
building what we felt was a worthy product.

Let's talk briefly
about some of my convictions for starting up instead of employment

1. I live to work, but not
solely for the money. What I do must have meaningful and varied
experiences.
2. I completely disagree with
the notion that employment is less risky than starting up a business, the
risks of employment are just superficially less visible.
  1. Employees are an
operational cost, which means employers are never really looking out for
you. Here are some examples off the top of my head:
    1. Upfronted bonus:
Sounds fantastic, but this is really so that employers pay less CPF
since there is a cap for wages, but none on bonuses;
    2. Contract jobs with the
possibility of permanent employment: structured to evade paid annual
leave;
    3. Subject to office politics
and limited promotion opportunities: Draw out your corporate ladder, and
statistically deduce your odds of getting to management
  2. Technology advancement in
autonomy means that we only need a few talent and a lot less 'paper'
pushers
  3. Pay to living cost is just
not what it was, and will probably get worse

Point 2b is an
extremely dire point of note that I wish to talk about in the near future.
**There is going to be a major shift**, which might lead to a **wonderful cashless
utopia**- but I cannot think of any realistic scenario that the path towards it
would not be paved with a lot suffering before or if we get there, and it **will
be within our generation**.

The above points
isn't exhaustive and really not well fleshed out at all, but it's a place to
start. I have included some links to publications that speak my mind about
this.

The namesake, **Absent
Consent** is about my resolution to not live in the expectations of others, and
choosing to live on my own terms, based on my own convictions. **Success should
be measured on your own rule and not based on public opinion**.

I live in a deeply
Asian society where there is a very strong perception of the conventional
method of success and stability, fierce aversion to risk and an unrelenting
fear of the loss of 'Face' / the same of failure.

But if we never
failed we will never learn to succeed. And to that the most natural notion is
to give up and console yourself with "At least you gave it a shot".

No one wins the hardest level of a game
without failing over and over till you get what it takes to beat it. The only
difference is real life and virtual reality.
