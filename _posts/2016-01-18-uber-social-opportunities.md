There are many
reasons why users love Uber - Let me rephrase. There are many reasons why Uber
riders love Uber.

Whether it is for
cost or convenience, the ride-sharing network company that employs no drivers.

As a first time Uber
driver, I have and still do - many concerns.

I have learned
through the strong opinions of many virtual opinions, that being an Uber driver
is not what it used to be.

In a calculated move
to springboard enough daily riders and drivers to hopefully build a
self-sustaining ecosystem, Uber very heavily incentivized new drivers and as
the goal to a self-sustaining ecosystem drew nearer, the need to continue
incentivizing it's drivers.

Many drivers have
since left while others are in a constant balancing act between fuel
consumption, time and overhead cost of vehicle.

Which begs the
question - Is it still worth being an Uber driver?

Perhaps not
**economically**, but the social opportunities are too good to pass up if you can
trudge through the perception of being a driver in a 'Face' obsessed Asian
society. 

But as an
entrepreneur, failure is the only method with which you will learn, and facing
social stigma of not being a big thing yet while trying to be is pretty much the very first job requirement.

If you can look pass
that, then good things do happen - like with me, on my very first day.

The six degrees of
separation theory theorizes that everyone and everything is six steps away, by
way of introduction from any other person in the world.

That sounds small
when put in a sentence, but if you've actually watched "My Date with
Drew", a 2004 documentary that uses the very same theory to yes, get a
date with Drew Barrymore - you would realize that- while possible, it is also
intensely laborious.

It is also not worth
the trouble, because it is not very different from traditional networking.

Everyone is trying
to connect upwards, and you are more than likely to find someone much like
yourself - in places that are about finding bigger opportunities, **rather than the opportunity provider**.

Let's face it, the
people that are in the position to provide these opportunities, don't need to
find people. More often than not the ones in true seats of power are
unassuming, reserved and they **do not readily
hand out their name cards**. 

Uber provides that
opportunity to be in a private box with somebody, anybody. More importantly, it's in space where there is no agenda on the table, only to be social. Which in any social networking convention or event, people
do try too hard to be.
